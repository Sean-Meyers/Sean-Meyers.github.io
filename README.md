**Question 1: What are some of the benefits of using a static site generator? What are some disadvantages?**

- Static site generator's are easy to get started on, and good for simple webpages, but can't update in realtime with POST and such. You won't create the next Facebook on a static website, but you can make some mean documentation or wikis.

**Question 2: What is the link to your GitHub pages hosted static site?**
